"""
The mentoring XBlock was previously designed to be edited using XML.

This file contains a hack necessary for us to parse the old XML data and create blocks in Studio
from the parsed XML, as part of the upgrade process.

It works by parsing the XML and creating XBlocks in a temporary runtime
environment, so that the blocks' fields can be read and copied into Studio.
